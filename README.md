## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

## Thoughts:

One of our first projects using MongoDB. It was a bit of a challenge at first, figuring out which database to use and how to use it! It's definitely gotten a lot easier with a number of trial and errors....
